The motivational quotes api was made using Node.js, Express, and hosted on Heroku. This is a simple
api that serves one purpose... To send a user motivational quotes.

# End Points

/quotes - Retrieve all quotes

/:id - Retrieves quote based on the id provided


# Purpose

I created this simple api to learn about express and heroku. My hope is to have others use this to learn the process of 
using an API.
